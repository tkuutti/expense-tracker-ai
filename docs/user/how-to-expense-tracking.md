## Tips & Best Practices

### Consistent Data Entry

**Vendor Names**
- Use consistent vendor names ("Ravintola Helsinki" not "ravintola helsinki" or "R. Helsinki")
- This ensures accurate vendor analysis and filtering

**Descriptions**
- Write clear, descriptive expense descriptions
- Include relevant details but keep them concise
- Examples: "Weekly groceries", "Lunch meeting with client", "Monthly gym membership"

**Categories**
- Be consistent with category selection
- Use "Other" sparingly - try to fit expenses into main categories
- Consider your own spending patterns when choosing categories

### Regular Data Maintenance

**Weekly Reviews**
- Enter expenses regularly to avoid forgetting details
- Review and correct any mistakes early
- Check for duplicate entries

**Monthly Analysis**
- Use category and vendor analysis to understand spending patterns
- Identify opportunities to reduce expenses
- Track progress toward spending goals

### Effective Search and Filtering

**Search Tips**
- Use partial words (search "rest" to find all restaurants)
- Try different spelling variations for better results
- Search in specific filter fields instead of general search for precise results

**Filter Combinations**
- Combine multiple filters for precise results
- Use date ranges to analyze spending in specific periods
- Clear all filters to return to complete expense list

### Finnish Number Format

**Correct Format**
- Always use comma for decimals: `15,50` not `15.50`
- Examples: `25,00`, `123,45`, `5,50`

**Common Mistakes**
- Don't use periods for decimals
- Don't leave incomplete decimals like `15,`
- The system will show validation errors for incorrect formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Please enter a valid amount" Error**
- **Cause**: Incorrect decimal separator
- **Solution**: Use comma (,) instead of period (.)
- **Correct**: `15,50`, `100,00`
- **Incorrect**: `15.50`, `15,`

**Expense Not Showing in List**
- **Check filters**: Clear all filters to see complete list
- **Verify save**: Check if expense was actually saved (look at total count)
- **Refresh page**: Sometimes a browser refresh helps

**Date Picker Issues**
- **Future dates**: The system prevents future dates by design
- **Format**: Ensure you're using DD.MM.YYYY format
- **Selection**: Make sure you've actually selected a date

**Search Not Working**
- **Clear filters**: Other filters might be conflicting
- **Try shorter terms**: Use partial words instead of complete phrases
- **Check spelling**: Try different variations or simpler terms

**Export Problems**
- **Browser settings**: Check download permissions
- **File access**: Ensure you can save files to Downloads folder
- **Try different browser**: If issues persist

### Getting Better Results

**Improve Organization**
- Develop consistent naming conventions early
- Use descriptive but concise expense descriptions
- Regular cleanup of vendor names and categories

**Better Search Results**
- Use shorter, more general search terms
- Try searching in specific fields rather than general search
