## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Form and Input Issues

**"Please enter a valid amount" Error**
- **Problem**: Using incorrect decimal separator
- **Solution**: Use comma (,) instead of period (.) for decimals
- **Correct Format**: 15,50, 123,00, 5,99
- **Incorrect Format**: 15.50, 15,, 15

**Amount Field Not Accepting Input**
- **Problem**: Browser or keyboard settings affecting number input
- **Solutions**:
  - Try typing the comma manually instead of using numeric keypad
  - Check browser language settings
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Try a different browser

**Form Won't Submit**
- **Problem**: Validation errors or missing required fields
- **Solutions**:
  - Look for red-bordered fields indicating errors
  - Read error messages below problematic fields
  - Ensure all required fields are filled
  - Check amount format uses comma for decimals
  - Verify date is selected and not in the future

#### Date and Time Issues

**Date Picker Not Working**
- **Problem**: Browser compatibility or JavaScript issues
- **Solutions**:
  - Try typing date manually in dd.MM.yyyy format
  - Clear browser cache and reload page
  - Enable JavaScript in browser settings
  - Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**"Cannot select future dates" Issue**
- **Problem**: Trying to select a date in the future
- **Solution**: This is intentional - only current and past dates are allowed
- **Workaround**: Select today's date or an earlier date
- **Note**: Future expense planning is not supported in current version

#### Display and Interface Issues

**Charts Not Showing**
- **Problem**: JavaScript errors or browser compatibility
- **Solutions**:
  - Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Check if JavaScript is enabled
  - Try a different browser
  - Ensure you have expenses in multiple categories for meaningful charts

**Dark Mode Not Working**
- **Problem**: Browser storage issues or JavaScript problems
- **Solutions**:
  - Click the theme toggle button again
  - Refresh the page
  - Clear browser local storage for the site
  - Check browser developer tools for errors

**Responsive Design Issues on Mobile**
- **Problem**: Layout not adapting to small screens
- **Solutions**:
  - Refresh the page
  - Clear mobile browser cache
  - Try rotating device between portrait and landscape
  - Update mobile browser to latest version

#### Data and Storage Issues

**Expenses Not Saving**
- **Problem**: Browser storage quota exceeded or disabled
- **Solutions**:

  - Clear other website data to free up storage space
  - Export current data before clearing storage
  - Check if you're in incognito/private browsing mode

**Expenses Disappeared**
- **Problem**: Browser data cleared or storage issues
- **Solutions**:
  - Check if filters are hiding your expenses (clear all filters)
  - Check browser history to see if data was accidentally cleared
  - Look for recent export files as backup
  - Verify you're using the same browser and device

**Export Not Working**
- **Problem**: Browser download settings or popup blockers
- **Solutions**:
  - Check browser download permissions
  - Disable popup blockers for the expense tracker site
  - Check Downloads folder - file might have downloaded without notification
  - Try right-clicking export button and "Save link as"

#### Search and Filter Problems

**Search Returning No Results**
- **Problem**: Too specific search terms or conflicting filters
- **Solutions**:
  - Clear all filters first, then search
  - Use shorter, more general search terms
  - Try searching for parts of words instead of complete phrases
  - Check if other filters are active and conflicting

**Filters Not Working**
- **Problem**: JavaScript errors or browser compatibility
- **Solutions**:
  - Refresh the page and try again
  - Clear all filters and start over
  - Try using one filter at a time to identify the problem
  - Check browser console for error messages

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Loading or Response
**Application Loading Slowly**
- **Problem**: Internet connection or browser performance
